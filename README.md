# EquiScope

## How can we measure a state’s ability to survive a financial crisis? 🎯

## Project Description 🤯
We created an interactive, data-driven dashboard that calculates each NC County's financial resilience and lets users define what “resilience” means to them. To make resilience measurable, we used publicly available, reliable data sources to represent key economic factors. Each dataset contributes to our final score based on its real-world importance. This tool empowers organizations to identify vulnerable regions and respond with targeted support, education, or resources with an AI focus on predictive identifying risks before they occur, optimizing distribution of limited resources, and guiding equitable decisions, allowing for human-reviewed interventions. 

## Project Value 💰
By leveraging county-level data on economic, social, and environmental factors, users can define and customize indicators based on their own priorities. Our tool provides an adaptable framework that is designed to incorporate additional datasets, incorporating an open-source, no-code tool, allowing real-time implementation. The transparency of the data and the ability to export insights ensure that stakeholders can make informed decisions, track progress, and implement interventions that promote equitable outcomes.
Target scope includes pilot partners in investment, infrastructure, and community development, whether for community engagement, policy planning, or internal analysis. In addition to offering understanding, it is a call to action: what will we do now that we know where we are vulnerable?  Sponsors and partners may engage with communities, customize programs and investments, and foster trust in areas that most need it by knowing where resilience gaps exist.
